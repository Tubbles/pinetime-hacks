# To Do

The repo is a personal PineTime/InfiniTime hacking playground; the feature list and statuses live in `README.md`, finished work is recorded in `doc/LOG.md` and git history. This file holds only what is outstanding or parked, and the reasoning behind those states.

## Active: field verification

- Gadgetbridge T resilience (GB T `6f2d749ba`, unverified): open the Intent API settings screen, then disconnect/reconnect the watch; the connection must reach "Connected" instead of sticking at "Connecting". If any leg stays dead, enable "Write log files" in GB T, reconnect once, and check for `failed btle action, aborting transaction`.

## Parked: 1. Clock sync (user decision 2026-08-03)

Field verdict after the fourth on-device round: "it hardly works at all ... i dont think its useful enough of a feature for this level of issues." The code stays in the tree (firmware service, Clock T bridge, CI) but no further debugging until the user un-parks it. Next diagnostic step if resumed: GB T file log of one phone-side play press (see the runbook troubleshooting section), since the epoch fix (InfiniTime `dfbd9676`) has still never been verified as delivered on-device. Known open v1 limitations (accepted): state characteristic is NOTIFY-only (no READ); timer expiry is not notified (phone derives it); stopwatch laps not synced; a watch-initiated stopwatch run cannot seed the phone's accumulated time; InfiniTime's timer has no pause, so phone-side pause maps to stopped.

## Planned: 2. Scheduled brightness + silent mode

On a schedule configured entirely on the watch (no hard-coded times), switch screen brightness and toggle silent mode. Example: at 20:00 go to lowest brightness + silent; at 07:00 go to middle brightness + full noise. Configuration lives on the watch. Not designed yet.

## Parked: next-event watch face corner (Napper)

Design: `doc/DESIGN.md`, research: `doc/research-{infinitime,napper,gadgetbridge}.md`.

Parked pending the user reaching out to Napper AB about cooperation / their thoughts. Standing finding: Napper offers no API, web client, widget, or notification carrying the time, so the only avenue was reading the app's on-screen output (ranked approaches in `doc/DESIGN.md` Leg 1). Nothing to do here until the outreach resolves.
